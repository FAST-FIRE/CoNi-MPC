INTRODUCTION
============

qpOASES is an open-source C++ implementation of the recently proposed 
online active set strategy (see [1], [2]), which was inspired by important 
observations from the field of parametric quadratic programming. It has 
several theoretical features that make it particularly suited for model 
predictive control (MPC) applications.

The software package qpOASES implements these ideas and has already been 
successfully used for many academic and industrial real-world applications, 
e.g. closed-loop control of a real-world Diesel engine testbench (see [3]). 
Recently, a couple of numerical modifications (as proposed in [4]) have been 
introduced that greatly increase qpOASES's reliability when solving
semi-definite, ill-posed or degenerated convex QPs.
