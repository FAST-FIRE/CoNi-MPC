REMARK:

This is not the original CSparse version but a specialized redristribution,
which comes along with ACADO Toolkit. The following changes have been made:

- This version contains only the C source-files of the original CSparse version.
- This version has replaced the original CSparse Makefile with an ACADO specific
  Makefile.
- The "C style" syntax of the original CSparse version has in some files been
  changed to a C++ compatible syntax to be able to compile the code not only
  with C but also with C++ compilers (we tested with gcc and g++). These changes
  boil down to "type casts" while there was no change of functionality.
