Support {#md_support}
=======

If you find simple bugs or lack some feature that you think would be relatively easy for us to add/or resolve, the simplest thing is simply to write to the [forum](https://sourceforge.net/p/acado/discussion/). We are trying to read the forum posts regularly and to respond as soon as possible.
> **NOTE:** Posts and/or emails simply stating "it does not work" with very little explanation will be treated with low priority.

In case you find a bug, want to contribute or simply have an idea about an enhancement, you can make a ticket on the [issue tracker](https://github.com/acado/acado/issues). The source code of the toolkit [is hosted on GitHub](http://github.com/acado/acado). In case you are willing to contribute and solve a bug:
- [make your own fork on GitHub](http://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo),
- work on the code and
- [make a pull request on GitHub](http://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests).

Thanx very much for understanding!

When you contact us regarding the bugs/problems, please do the following:

* state the code version: send us output of the command: `git rev-parse HEAD` (this should work in Linux/OS X/Cygwin);
* state the nature of the problem and
* in case you cannot compile the code paste the compiler output .

The only thing we expect for this kind of support is that you [cite us](@ref md_citing), whenever you use the ACADO toolkit in scientific work (look [here](@ref md_features) for more info).

If you want more help, we are always open for **academic** or **industrial cooperation**. An academic cooperation usually takes the form of a co-authorship of a journal paper, and an industrial cooperation involves a negotiated consulting contract. Please contact the us directly via the email [support@acadotoolkit.org](mailto:support@acadotoolkit.org) if you are interested in this.
